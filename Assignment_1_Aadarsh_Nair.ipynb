For both stakeholder considerations 1 and 2, the hotel name and the airline flights stay the same. Due to this, there are no changes in lodging costs and airline costs. However, when adding the costs from the considerations (for consideration 1: the per diem daily allowance for food and for consideration 2: the networking event cost to provide to event participants, this causes more money to be spent from the budget. The original solution involves spending $1065.00 from the budget, while consideration 1 involves spending $1305.00 and consideration 2 involves spending $1405.00. This would be the biggest tradeoff, the available money left to be spent on from the budget is less due to the spendings for these considerations.]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Z1Zf2ORP8fST"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Create visualization comparing original vs updated solution\n","# Show tradeoffs introduced by stakeholder considerations"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5XMSQ5R_8fSU"},"source":["## Executive Summary\n","\n","**Instructions:** Write a professional summary suitable for presenting to stakeholders.
